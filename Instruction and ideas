For this program, I hard coded the number of questions. I can increase the number of questions there to keep the idiot busy for hours after hours.
I will try in the future to use variables instead of using hard coded numbers.
Regular expressions are gems. These make life so easy.
Pyinputplus does a great job for input validation.
